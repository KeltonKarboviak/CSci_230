HW-9	CS230	10 points	Due: 4/23/14

Tweak your HW8 code (random walk) to extract every bit of performance 
possible. At minimum, you need to generate and Excel plot that shows 
runtime vs optimization tried (vertical axis should be runtime, horizontal
axis should be optimization tried). Your chart needs to have at least 
5 different optimizations.

Your worst runtime needs to be around 30 seconds, so you will probably
have to wrap your code in a for-loop to get it to run long enough. I suggest 
you pick a seed for the random number generator too.

To measure the runtime, you will need to add a time counter (clock) to your code.
