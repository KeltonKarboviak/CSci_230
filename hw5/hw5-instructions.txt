HW-5	CS230	10 points	Due: 3/3/2014

Break your HW-4 program up into parts (sub-files).

1) One file will contain the function that loads a file.
   Call it hw5-yourname-load.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw5-yourname-load.h

2) One file will contain the function that finds the location
   in the DNA data where the FASTA data is.
   Call it hw5-yourname-find.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw5-yourname-find.h

3) One file will contain the function that determines and
   displays the forward primer.
   Call it hw5-yourname-forward.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw5-yourname-forward.h

4) One file will contain the function that detertimes and
   displays the reverse primer.
   Call it hw5-yourname-reverse.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw5-yourname-reverse.h

5) One file will be the main routine.
   Call it hw5-yourname-main.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw5-yourname-main.h


Finally, you will need a makefile that includes:
1) An "all" option
2) A "hw5-yourname-load.o" option
3) A "hw5-yourname-find.o" option
4) A "hw5-yourname-forward.o" option
5) A "hw5-yourname-reverse.o" option
6) A "clean" option

The makefile must use variables for the compiler (gcc or g++) and
the compiler flags (-c and -Wall).

Each option in the make file must include the appropriate dependencies.

Call the makefile yourname-makefile

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 115/109 or on shell.aero.und.edu.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of each source
   file (including the header files).

3. Your source code must be submitted as a single tarball called
   hw5-yourname.tar. I will !!!NOT!!! accept submissions that are not single
   tarballs.

4. Email your source (subject hw5-yourname) to rmarsh@cs.und.edu
