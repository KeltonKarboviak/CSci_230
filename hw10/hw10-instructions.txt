HW-10	CS230		40 points	Due: May 9

For this assignment you will divide up HW-5 and develop a
Makefile to practice using the compiler and linker with
libraries. All files will be strictly C code - no C++!

Part 1 (10 points):
------------------
Separate HW-5 into the following files:
1) One file will contain the function that loads a file. 
   Call it hw10-yourname-load.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw10-yourname-load.h

2) One file will contain the function that finds the location 
   in the DNA data where the FASTA data is. 
   Call it hw10-yourname-find.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw10-yourname-find.h

3) One file will contain the function that determines and 
   displays the forward primer.
   Call it hw10-yourname-forward.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw10-yourname-forward.h

4) One file will contain the function that determines and 
   displays the reverse primer.
   Call it hw10-yourname-reverse.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw10-yourname-reverse.h

5) One file will be the main routine.
   Call it hw10-yourname-main.c
   This file will also require a header file.
   Call it hw10-yourname-main.h

Write a Makefile that compiles and links the above in 2 (two) 
steps. You MUST call this Makefile "Makefile1".


Part 2 (5 points):
------------------
Write a Makefile that creates a STATIC library/archive 
(hw10-lib-yourname.a) out of the associated c files (1, 2, 3, & 
4) and that compiles and links hw10-yourname-main.c with your static 
library. You MUST call this Makefile "Makefile2".


Part 3 (5 points):
------------------
Write a Makefile that creates SHARED a library 
(hw10-lib-yourname.so) out of the associated c files (1, 2, 3, & 
4) and that compiles and links hw10-yourname-main.c with your shared
library. You MUST call this Makefile "Makefile3".


Part 4 (20 points):
-------------------
Modify hw10-yourname-main.c to use the SHARED library 
(hw10-lib-yourname.so) dynamically (using dlopen). Call 
this MAIN program hw10-yourname-4.c

Write a Makefile that compiles and links hw10-yourname-4.c
with your dynamic shared library. You MUST call this 
Makefile "Makefile4".

Note that all of the functionality must exist in this program
as it did in hw5 to earn full credit.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 115/109 or on shell.aero.und.edu.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of each file
   of your program.

3. Your tarball must be named hw10-yourname.tar

4. Email your source (subject hw10-yourname) to rmarsh@cs.und.edu
